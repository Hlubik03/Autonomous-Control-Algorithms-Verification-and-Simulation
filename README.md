# Autonomous-Control-Algorithms-Verification-and-Simulation
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and verification of control algorithms for autonomous systems.
The implementation leverages classical algorithmic approaches, including Breadth-First Search (BFS) for systematic state-space exploration, as well as fundamental data structures such as stacks and queues to manage control logic and traversal processes.
The main objective is to verify the correctness, safety, and robustness of autonomous behavior under various operating conditions. A requirement-driven approach is used to ensure that the implemented control logic behaves as intended across different scenarios.
Key features of the project include:
Design of autonomous control algorithms
State-space exploration using Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Use of stacks and queues for algorithm control flow
Simulation of system behavior under multiple scenarios
Verification of algorithm correctness against defined requirements
The project was developed as part of a university course and demonstrates a strong foundation in algorithm design, control systems, and verification methodologies applicable to autonomous and intelligent systems.
