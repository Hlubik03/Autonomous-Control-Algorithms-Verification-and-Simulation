# Autonomous-Control-Algorithms-Verification-and-Simulation
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the **design, simulation, and verification of control algorithms for autonomous systems**.

The implementation leverages **classical algorithmic approaches**, including **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for systematic state-space exploration, along with fundamental data structures such as **stacks and queues** to manage control logic and traversal processes.

The main objective is to verify the **correctness, safety, and robustness** of autonomous behavior under various operating conditions. A **requirement-driven approach** is employed to ensure that the implemented control logic behaves as intended across different scenarios.
